PolicyPad: Real-Time Collaborative HTML Editing 
===============================================

PolicyPad is a JavaScript library that allows the collaboritive editing
environment of EtherPad to be used outside of the EtherPad client page. This is
accomplished by the library acting as a sort of translation layer between a
specific editor and an existing EtherPad installation. PolicyPad is not meant to
be editor-specific, but rather a general solution which can be adapted to suit
various editors. Currently, PolicyPad includes this plugin implementation for
WYMeditor, though other editors should also be very possible.
