PolicyPad: Real-Time Collaborative HTML Editing
===============================================

PolicyPad is a JavaScript library that allows the collaborative real-time 
editing abilities of EtherPad to your favorite wysiwyg editor in the browser.
PolicyPad is not meant to be editor-specific, but rather be a general solution
which can be adapted to suit various editors. Currently, PolicyPad includes a
plugin implementation for WYMeditor, though support for other JavaScript
text/html editors is planned.

In its current state, collaborative editing via WYMeditor is very functional
minus a few intermittent bugs that appear on old browser, slow computers or
with very fast changes.
