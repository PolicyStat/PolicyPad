PolicyPad: Real-Time Collaborative HTML Editing
===============================================

PolicyPad is a JavaScript library that allows the collaborative editing
environment of EtherPad to be used outside of the EtherPad client page.
PolicyPad is not meant to be editor-specific, but rather be a general solution
which can be adapted to suit various editors. Currently, PolicyPad includes a
plugin implementation for WYMeditor, though support for any other JavaScript
text/html editor could be added
